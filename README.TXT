## Track your characters lockouts across multiple accounts
More info at: https://wow-lockouts-io.vercel.app/

#### How it works:
- Your in game characters will send and receive lockouts with other players storing it locally

- Ones with the desktop client running, will parse the storage and upload lockouts data to our servers



##### Installation:
- Install the latest version or checkout the latest Github release

- Install and run the client to sync your character data

   - The client is not mandatory to have, since your character data will be communicated to other character in game and then uploaded by the ones with the client running

   - Yes, is a nice to have to have more real time data

- Visit https://wow-lockouts-io.vercel.app/ and search your character, for example: https://wow-lockouts-io.vercel.app/lockouts?character_name=Weskey-Earthshaker



#### Features:
- Track your characters lockouts uploading data to https://wow-lockouts-io.vercel.app/ 

- Centralized platform to check which encounters are available or not on your character without logging in 

- Possibility to have public or private data on the server, public lockouts will be visibile to everyone





#### Upcoming next:
